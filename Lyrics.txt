----------(Part 1)----------
Is it tears of happines Im feeling,
or am I melting away

The children are joyful with the presents,
but Santas absence is marking my end

Why wasn't I born in the North Pole,
Without my Ice Queen my heart will break

I wish I could stay a bit longer,
but the river is awaing me

My heart is as delicate as ever,
a fragile snowball that iiIIIiis

Rain is a deafening bell,
a worthwhile distraction from liquidation

Disfigurement is not the case,
but will your love for me change,

Will you be able to tell apart,
this pile of snow from me

I'll be reborn at the next Christmass,
But Bae will God let me have memories...

----------(Part 2)----------

Girl you are my very own North Star,
But without it___I don't know where to go

A sense of direction I don't have anymore,
and my will___left me long ago

Sensetion to scream, but my mouth has melted,
OU SHIT THE PAAAIINNNN, ITS STARTING TO GET TO ME

CHANING STATES OF MATTER OHH FUCK THE TORTURE,
PLEASE LOORD IS MY FORTUUUNEEEEEE!!!

----------(Part 3)----------

Is it tears of happines Im feeling,
or am I melting awayyyyyyyyyyyyy

The children are joyful with the presents,
but Santas absence, is marking my End

Why wasn't I born in the North Pole,
Without my Ice Queen, my heart, will brEAak

I wish I could stay a bit longer,
but the river is awaing me

My heart is as delicate as ever,

Rain is a dEAfening bell,
a worthwhile distraction from liquidation

Disfigurement is not the case,
but will your l0ve for me change,

Will you be able to rescue me,
(When) || (While) an avalanche absorbs me in a blink,  //Commnet : Depents which one rhymes at the moment

----------(Part 4)----------

I don't know where to go anymore,
Parts of my body spreadin' throught the floor

Part of me touching power grid,
Billions of boltz electrocuting me

Water mother earth pleasently,
Apocaliptyc flood drowing ant colony

Importance of regrets failed to make me live,
WhAt jOkE?! LAsT wORDS!? FUCKING END MEEEEEEE

Is it tears of happines im feeling,
or am i (just) melting away,

the children are joyfull witht the presents,
but santas absence,,, is marking my eeennddd.
